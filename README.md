# DevOps with Docker, Kubernetes, and Minikube

## Overview

Welcome to my DevOps journey! This repository showcases my experience in setting up and streamlining DevOps workflows using various powerful tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, and Minikube. The project provides a practical approach to building, testing, and deploying Python-based applications through a robust CI/CD pipeline, containerization, and orchestration.

Throughout this project, I have documented the process in a series of blog posts, where I explain the methodologies, strategies, and lessons learned. The entire process was aimed at improving the efficiency of the development lifecycle, ensuring faster deployments, and automating processes.

> **Key Technologies Used:**
> - **Docker**: Containerization of applications for environment consistency.
> - **Kubernetes**: Orchestration for managing the containers at scale.
> - **Minikube**: A local Kubernetes environment for testing and development.
> - **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD for automating the build, test, and deployment workflows.

## Project Highlights

### 1. **Containerizing a Python Web Application**

   The first step of the project was building a simple **Flask** application and Dockerizing it. Docker allowed me to encapsulate the application in a container, making it portable and easy to deploy across any environment.


### 2. **Creating CI/CD Pipelines with GitHub Actions**

   I set up continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines using **GitHub Actions**. This automated the entire process from code push to deployment, ensuring that changes were automatically tested, built, and deployed on every update.



### 3. **Local Kubernetes Environment with Minikube**

   Using **Minikube**, I created a local Kubernetes environment to simulate production-like deployments. This allowed me to manage the app's containers effectively and test the scalability of the application.


### 4. **Exploring Kubernetes Deployment Strategies**

   The project included the exploration of different **Kubernetes deployment strategies**. From simple pods to more advanced methods like **Helm**, I gained valuable insights into managing complex application deployments at scale.



## Learning and Insights

Throughout this project, I learned how to:
- **Leverage Docker** for containerization, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **Automate workflows with GitHub Actions**, from code checks to deploying applications seamlessly.
- **Use Kubernetes and Minikube** for managing and deploying applications at scale in a controlled environment.
- **Handle Infrastructure as Code** with tools like Helm and Terraform, making the deployment process easier and more reproducible.
